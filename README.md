I am creating a website on a Premier League memory game. The page will have a grid with 20 blank boxes displayed. There will be an image behind each box and the user will click on a box which will reveal a Premier League club logo. The aim of the game is to match the same logo in just 2 clicks and the images will be removed. The game will finish when all logos have been matched. The user will be given a message, rating and time and the option to play again. The user can then see how well they did so they can try and beat this score in the future.

The business goal of the website is to get as many people playing the game as possible and to make it fun so that more people keep coming back to play. I want to make the game as easy to understand and have a good quality looking site. If the game is a success then I would look into expanding the game or creating more games.
The user goal of this website is to test their memory of which is great for keeping the brain active. It is also fun for people of all ages to test themselves against friends and family. I have used football badges as this is something I am personally interested in but the user doesnâ€™t have to be a football fan to enjoy the game.

# UX

## Ideal Client

Ideal user of this site would be:
* People who enjoy playing memory games.
*	English Football fans who know the club badges
*	People who read English to understand the rules
*	People who have a bit of time to spare to play a fun game

## Client Stories
*	As a visitor to the website I want to see that the grid has loaded properly which will display 20 English football club badges. There will be 10 different badges 2 from each team.
*	As a visitor to the website when 2 badges are selected I should be updated if they are a match or not. If they are a match they will turn green and stay on the page. If they are not a match they will turn red and disappear.
*	As a visitor to the website I want to play the full game to see if the rating and time features are working as they should be. 
*	As a visitor to the website I want to finish a game and then see if I play again using the button provided 
*	As a returning visitor to the website I want to see if the game is still running correctly as if any new features have been added.
